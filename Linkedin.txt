🚗 Excited to share my latest Computer Vision project!

I built a Vehicle Detection & Red Light Violation System using YOLOv8 and OpenCV that automatically detects vehicles running red lights in traffic footage.

🔧 Tech Stack:
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

✨ Key Features:
- Real-time vehicle detection and tracking using YOLO object detection
- Automated red light violation detection based on stop line crossing
- Flashing visual alerts for violating vehicles
- Automatic cropping and saving of violation evidence
- Annotated output video with bounding boxes and violation count

🎯 How It Works:
1. The system tracks vehicles frame-by-frame using YOLOv8
2. A virtual stop line is defined in the camera's field of view
3. When the traffic signal turns red, any vehicle crossing the stop line is flagged as a violation
4. Violating vehicles get a flashing red box with "VIOLATION!" text
5. Cropped images are automatically saved as evidence

📊 Results:
- Successfully detected 18 violations in a sample traffic video
- Processes video at ~5 FPS with annotation overlay
- Generates evidence images automatically

🔗 This project demonstrates practical applications of deep learning in traffic monitoring and could be extended for real-world smart city implementations.
